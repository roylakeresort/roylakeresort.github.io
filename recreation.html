    The glacial lakes, including Roy Lake, remain a favorite with 
    fisherman who enjoy fishing or for families wanting to experience 
    fishing. Roy Lake contains all types of fish including walleyes, 
    crappie, bluegill, perch, small mouth bass, large mouth bass, 
    and northern pike. Sit off one of our docks or 
    <a href="/boats">rent a boat</a> or go with 
    <a href="/guiding">our guide</a> for a great individual 
    or family fishing experience on any of the glacial lakes in the 
    area that happen to have fish biting!

    The surrounding area in Marshall County South Dakota has 
    one of the most public hunting areas (~55,000 acres) outside 
    of the Black Hills! In this area you can hunt deer, turkey, 
    waterfowl, and pheasants! If you would prefer to hunt in 
    North Dakota, the resort is only 20 minutes from Sargent County 
    North Dakota.
