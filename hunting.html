<h2 id="pheasant">Pheasant</h2>

<p>
    Pheasant numbers done by the SD GF&amp;P shows numbers 
    in the Roy Lake area to be the one of the strongest 
    in the state. The state has received a lot of water, 
    but our elevation is so high at 1900 ft that the water 
    drains off and doesn't disturb hatching.

<h2 id="waterfowl">Waterfowl</h2>

<p>
    There is a lot of water to allow a lot of waterfowl 
    to rest on their long trip south. We are in a perfect 
    fly way for snow geese, blue geese, ducks, mallards, and swans.
</p>

<h2 id="turkey">Turkey</h2>

<p>
    We have a burgeoning groups of turkeys in the area. 
    They even walk and gobble inbetween the cabins. Instead 
    of having Butterball or Jennie'o's turkey, why don't you 
    bag your own?
