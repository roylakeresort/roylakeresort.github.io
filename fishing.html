<h2 id="openwater">Openwater Fishing</h2>

<p>
    One of the most popular fishing times is when the lake 
    is not frozen. Fishing can be done from one of our many 
    docks or from a <a href="/boats">boat</a> or you can ask 
    about our <a href="/guiding">guiding services</a>!
</p>

<h2 id="ice-fishing">Ice Fishing</h2>

<p>
    We typically see first ice on the lake around Thanksgiving 
    and lasting until the first week of April. <a href="/contact-us">Contact us</a> for 
    the latest ice report and to be put on our occasional 
    fishing email list!
