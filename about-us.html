<h2>History</h2>

<div class="col-xs-7 pull-right"><img class="img-polaroid img-responsive" src="/img/rlr_resort_aerial_peninsula.jpg"></div>

<p>
    Evidence of a prehistoric Indian village has been discovered 
    at Roy Lake. Preliminary work by the state archaeologist has 
    identified artifacts found as belonging to the Great Oasis Culture 
    whose people occupied this region about 900-1300 A.D. 
    The Roy, or Roi, family is credited with building the first 
    recorded non-Indian settlement. Local Indians called the crops 
    planted along the lake shore the "Roy Planting," and the name 
    has persisted. In 1946 Roy Lake was brought into the state 
    park system after completion of land acquisition. From a 
    beginning of a few cabins and dirt roads, the area has 
    developed into a popular state park and resort for family fun 
    and recreation.

  It's Time to Come Back!
</p>

<p>
    One summer morning in 1992 I was surprised to see one of the 
    lakes from the memories of my childhood...Roy Lake. It had 
    been a long drive from Texas to see my parents in Gwinner, ND, 
    and I thought I would take a shortcut, not knowing that this 
    drive was destined to change my life forever.
</p>

<p>
    I had always told my boys how important roots are. That they 
    are a road map of where we came from and an indicator of where 
    we are going. Having lived all around the U.S., I had always felt like a round peg trying to fit into a square hole. Little did I know that the process of a life-long struggle was now going to come to an end as I said to the boys with a big grin, "Next summer we are renting a cabin at Roy Lake."
</p>

<p>
    What a window of opportunity the summer of 1993 was. The resort 
    was for sale and not worrying about next month or next year and 
    taking one day at a time, I started the process of purchasing the 
    resort.
</p>

<p>
    The moving van arrived October 13, 1993 and then the worry. 
    "Where will the furniture go, it will take months to unpack; 
    and, of course, how do I open the resort for winter business? But 
    as I got here, one day at a time, so will 1993/1994 go.
</p>

<p>
    What has amazed me are the number of people who call or come 
    by and say, "I used to come here when I was a kid" or "Grandpa 
    always took me fishing at Roy Lake." Now there will be another 
    generation that will say, "Remember that summer of 1994 when 
    Grandpa took me fishing at Roy Lake and we caught that big walleye."
</p>

<p>
    Yes, it is time to come back!
