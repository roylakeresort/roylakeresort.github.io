<h3>Welcome to the Roy Lake Resort &amp; Lodge <span class="warning">"For Sale"</span> page </h3>

<p>
    This page has links that you can go to access information 
    for interested parties that have an interest in possibly 
    purchasing the resort.
</p>

<p>
    After 23 years Jan (Thames) Pitzl has decided it is time 
    to retire and write a book on her life stories around the 
    resort.  While making that decision she has put up an excellent 
    opportunity for people with the interest in the outdoors, owning 
    their own business, and making a career change that will positively 
    change your lives for you and your family forever.
</p>

<p>
    Jan took over Roy Lake Resort in the Fall of 1993 with 
    two small boys, ages 8 and 12, and while operating the business 
    throughout their lives taught them invaluable life and business 
    mindsets that they will forever hold on to.  Not to mention, 
    "handyman" skills, fishing and hunting skills, people skills, 
    small engine maintenance and many other fine-tuned skills that 
    they would not have achieved with any other experience.  So, if 
    you have a family- this is the PERFECT setting for raising kids 
    as they grow into adults.  Not to mention the beautiful environment 
    you are surrounded in, the great people in the local area and the 
    excellent school systems.  See our <a href="/about-us">"ABOUT US"</a> 
    page for more!

<h2>A few FAQ's</h2>

<p class="strong">Q. Does this mean that Roy Lake Resort won't be 
    open until new owner's take title?
</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Absolutely not, we are here to give you the 
    best experience and service we can and we will continue doing 
    so throughout this whole process.  The marketing of the resort 
    for sale will have zero effect on its operations and we 
    encourage you to call us or email us and reserve your stay now.
</p>

<p class="strong">Q. Why is it only a 10 year land lease, why not a 
    XX year lease?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The lease is extendable throughout your term.  
    For example, any improvements we or you make the lease gets 
    extended.  In our example- By extending the lease we are still 
    operating on the terms of our original 1994 lease on an 
    original 10 year lease.  We have effectively never signed 
    a new lease in the 23 years we have been here and you can do 
    the same.  So don't let that number prematurely turn you away, 
    let's also not forget that with all contracts- they are always 
    negotiable.
</p>

<p class="strong">Q. Why do we have to contact the state for the sale?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Since we are a "concessaire" inside a South Dakota 
    state park, the state is offering a brand-new lease with whomever 
    purchases the resort.  This means that the state would like to 
    know more about you and your capabilities before they grant a 
    new lease with an individual, family or investor(s).  The state 
    currently has more than 10 concessaires inside state parks across 
    the state including Louis &amp; Clark Marina by Yankton, 
    Custer State Park and all of the hotels/resorts located inside.  
    So as this may be unique, Roy Lake Resort and prospective owners 
    are not alone and the process has been completed multiple times 
    throughout the decades in other parks.
</p>

<p class="strong">Q. Does leasing the land mean I am leasing the 
    buildings and only buying the "business"?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> No, everything on the land- all buildings, 
    assets, FF&amp;E, any improvements etc etc... belong to you and 
    will always belong to you.  The only thing leased is the land, 
    you will always have full ownership of all assets at all times.
</p>

<p class="strong">Q. Why would I want to lease the land and not buy 
    land and start my own business?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> A few reasons- First, Location.  We are 
    established on a peninsula on Roy Lake and are surrounded by 
    water on all three sides which you will not find anywhere else, 
    we promise you- we've tried.  Second, Price.  With the price of 
    shoreline where it is right now (currently between $2,000 and 
    $2,500/linear foot of shore line) the resort would be out of 
    the price range of most with a sale price of being somewhere 
    around the $5,000,000 dollar range instead of the reduced
    price of $739,000 from the appraised value of $975,000 price that 
    we have listed it at (which by the way is well below 
    value of assets by about $500,000).
</p>

<p class="strong">Q. Why would you lower your price below the value?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> We feel that this is a great investment for 
    someone with a family, for someone to learn and grow the way 
    Jan and her sons did. Regardless if it's a family or an individual 
    or a group of investors become the new owners, we felt that we 
    would price it in a range that we believe makes it available to 
    most people that dream of owning their own resort on one of the 
    best fishing lakes around and one of the most beautiful areas in 
    the Couteau de Prairies Hills and Glacial Lakes of South Dakota.
</p>

<p class="strong">Q. The prospectus says the deadline. Does that mean 
    that is all the time I have?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes and No.   
    What that means is that all proposals must be submitted to 
    Sean Blanchette by that deadline.  If there is just one 
    proposal submitted with all of the appropriate documents then 
    there may not be another chance for submittal.  HOWEVER, if no 
    proposals are submitted by the deadline date then the prospectus 
    will go to the SD GF&amp;P commission for an extension, usually 
    an extension will be 2-3 months.  It is in your best interest to 
    stay in contact with Sean Blanchette throughout your process and 
    if you do need another week past deadline he can advise 
    Roy Lake Resort to do a shorter extension i.e. one week, 
    SHALL you have everything you need ready to go such as 
    preapproval from a lender or whatever your case may be.  
    -In Short- the deadline is the deadline, but it is also not 
    the deadline, it just depends if someone DOES submit a proposal 
    before or by the deadline then there may not be another 
    deadline/extension, no matter how short the period.
